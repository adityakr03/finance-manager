## 🛠️ How It Works

### 1. **Data Storage**  
   - All financial data (income, expenses, categories) is securely stored in the browser's local storage.  
   - Allows offline access and removes reliance on external servers.

### 2. **Data Encryption**  
   - Data is encrypted using **AES-256** before being saved in local storage.  
   - The key used for encryption is also encrypted and stored in the same way.  
   - Every time data is encrypted, a new dynamic key is generated, ensuring no static key is ever stored.  
   - Without the encrypted key, the data is effectively inaccessible and cannot be tampered with.

### 3. **Privacy-Centric Design**  
   - The app operates entirely within your device, ensuring zero data leakage.  
   - No analytics, trackers, or third-party integrations.
