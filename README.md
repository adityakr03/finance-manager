## How It Works

### 1. **Data Storage**  
   - All financial records (income, expenses, categories, and totals) are stored in the browser's local storage.  
   - This ensures the application functions offline and removes reliance on external services.

### 2. **Data Encryption**  
   - Every piece of data stored in the local storage is encrypted using the **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**.  
   - Upon entering data, it is encrypted before being saved and decrypted only when displayed to the user.

### 3. **Privacy-Centric Design**  
   - No personal information or financial data is shared with third parties.  
   - The entire application runs locally, leaving no digital footprint.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structuring the web application.  
- **CSS3**: Styling for an intuitive and modern UI.  
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic interactivity and core functionality.  
- **AES.js**: Data encryption library.

---

## Limitations
1. **No Multi-User Support**  
   - Currently designed for single-user use.  
   - All data is specific to the device and browser it is accessed from.

2. **Device-Specific Storage**  
   - Data stored in local storage is device-specific. Switching devices will not retain previous data.

---

## Roadmap

- Add **multi-user support** with optional cloud storage for data sync.  
- Include budget planning and alerts for overspending.  
- Enhance encryption methods to integrate with hardware security modules (HSM).
